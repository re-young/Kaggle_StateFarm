# Kaggle State Farm Competition

This is my work in julia for for the (State Farm Distracted Driver Detection)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection].  Lacking a good gpu serious progress may be difficult, but it will be fun to learn mocho.jl and try to build and test some convolutional neural networks in a new language.
