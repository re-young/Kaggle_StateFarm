## Kaggle State Farm Competition

This is my work in julia for for the [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection).  Lacking a good gpu serious progress may be difficult, but it will be fun to learn mocha.jl and try to build and test some convolutional neural networks in a new language.

#To Do:
1. Split training data into training and small validation set 
 * Train on 7 drivers test on other two

 * Consider gender
2. Add dropout layers
